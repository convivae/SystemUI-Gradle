# Orchestration State

> Technical live state: `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` (sole complete owner — build matrix,
> tests, blockers, roadmap; do not duplicate numbers here).
> The architect MUST re-read this file (with CHARTER.md and the tail of log.md)
> before every dispatch, review, or merge action.

## Active Workers

- None.

## Queue

1. Next bounded build task: SettingsLib 74 program/resource closure
   (technical detail and ordering: `docs/CURRENT_STATE.md` → "Next ordered work").

## Recent Orchestration Transitions

- 2026-08-20 — Task 038 (Traceur dual AARs) merged after dual-axis PASS
  (`dee92a90` + `8b3bb275`) and main fresh verification completed.
- 2026-08-20 — Task 039 design approved; governance spec + plan + brief committed
  (`2545bdc9`, `7b24b7c6`); worker dispatched with GLM-5.3 and verified CONTRACT.
- 2026-08-20 — Task 039 worker completed at `04a13473`; initial Standards review
  found one MEDIUM lifecycle mismatch, revision fixed it, and final Standards + Spec
  re-review both passed with no BLOCKER/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW findings.
- 2026-08-20 — Task 039 cherry-picked to main; the `STATE.md` dispatch conflict was
  resolved by preserving the narrowed orchestration-only role and the newer transition.
  Main fresh static verification passed; no Gradle task was run by design.
- Full event history: `docs/orchestration/log.md` (append-only).

## Last Updated

2026-08-20 — Task 039 documentation governance is merged and main-verified.
